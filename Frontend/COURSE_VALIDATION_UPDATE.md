# Course Validation Update - Frontend & Backend Changes

## Overview
Updated the "Add Routine" functionality to fetch courses from the database and validate course-teacher assignments before allowing routine creation.

## Backend Changes

### New API Endpoint: GET /api/admin/courses/teacher/{teacherId}

**Purpose**: Fetch courses assigned to a specific teacher

**Request**: 
```http
GET /api/admin/courses/teacher/5
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response**:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "teacherId": 5,
    "teacherName": "Dr. John Smith",
    "courses": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "code": "CSE101",
            "title": "Introduction to Programming",
            "credit": 3,
            "description": "Basic programming concepts"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Features**:
- Admin role validation
- Teacher existence check
- Returns teacher's assigned courses via enrollment system

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Removed Dummy Course Data
**Before**:
```typescript
const courses = [
  { id: 1, title: 'Computer Science 101', batches: ['20', '21'] },
  // ... hardcoded course data
];
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Courses fetched from database via API
const [courses, setCourses] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [teacherCourses, setTeacherCourses] = useState<any[]>([]);
```

### 2. Dynamic Course Loading
**New Functions**:
```typescript
const fetchCourses = async () => {
  // Fetch all courses from /api/admin/courses
};

const fetchTeacherCourses = async (teacherId: string) => {
  // Fetch courses assigned to specific teacher
};
```

### 3. Updated Course Selection Logic
**Before**: Courses filtered by batch
```typescript
const getCoursesForBatch = (batch: string) => {
  return courses.filter(course => course.batches.includes(batch));
};
```

**After**: Courses filtered by teacher assignment
```typescript
const getAvailableCourses = () => {
  return teacherCourses; // Only courses assigned to selected teacher
};
```

### 4. Enhanced Form Validation
**Course-Teacher Validation**:
```typescript
const isValidCourseTeacherMatch = teacherCourses.some(course => 
  course.id.toString() === formData.courseId
);

if (!isValidCourseTeacherMatch) {
  alert('Selected course is not assigned to the selected teacher.');
  return;
}
```

### 5. Updated User Interface

#### Teacher Selection
- Triggers course loading when teacher is selected
- Clears course selection when teacher changes
- Shows teacher username for identification

#### Course Selection
- **Disabled until teacher is selected**
- Shows only courses assigned to selected teacher
- Displays course code and title: "CSE101 - Introduction to Programming"
- Shows helpful messages:
  - "Select teacher first"
  - "No courses assigned to teacher"

#### Validation Messages
- **Pre-submission**: Form validation prevents submission with invalid data
- **Course assignment check**: Validates course-teacher relationship
- **API errors**: Shows backend validation errors

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Logical Flow
1. Select Batch (20-29)
2. Select Day
3. Enter Time
4. **Select Teacher** (triggers course loading)
5. **Select Course** (only shows teacher's courses)
6. Submit with validation

### 2. Real-time Feedback
- Loading states for all API calls
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Helpful placeholder text and instructions

### 3. Data Integrity
- **No dummy data**: All courses from database
- **Validated relationships**: Course-teacher assignments verified
- **Consistent API**: Uses new `/api/routine` endpoint with username

## API Integration

### Routine Creation Payload
**Updated Format**:
```json
{
  "courseId": 1,
  "courseTime": "09:00",
  "day": "Monday",
  "username": "dr_smith",
  "studentBatch": "20"
}
```

**Validation Chain**:
1. Frontend validates course-teacher assignment
2. Backend validates course exists
3. Backend validates teacher username exists
4. Backend validates student batch exists
5. Backend checks for duplicate routines

## Benefits

1. **Data Accuracy**: No hardcoded course data
2. **Relationship Integrity**: Ensures valid course-teacher assignments
3. **User Guidance**: Clear form flow and validation messages
4. **Real-time Validation**: Prevents invalid combinations before submission
5. **Scalability**: Works with any number of courses and teachers from database

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Valid Flow**: Select teacher → see assigned courses → select course → create routine
2. **No Courses**: Select teacher with no assigned courses → see message
3. **Validation**: Try to submit with invalid course-teacher combination → see error
4. **API Errors**: Handle network errors and backend validation failures
5. **Form Reset**: Changing teacher clears course selection appropriately
